- 👋 Hi, I’m Bhanu Prakash Mopidevi
- 👀 Most of my LLM related code is PRIVATE currently as I am active in a competition, and making it PUBLIC would reveal my strategy :)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Agentic workflows using LLMs
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Multi Modal or Generative AI research work.
